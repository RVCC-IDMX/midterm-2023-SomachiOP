 <h2>Here are some reviews from our clients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>"A culinary delight in web design! This site's layout
       is intuitive, colors harmonious, and details meticulously
       placed. Interactivity engages like a culinary showstopper.
        Mobile experience is seamless. It's a testament to passion 
        and expertise. This man definitely knows where the lamb sauce is!"
      
      -Gordon Ramsay, Worldstar Chef</li>

    <li>"HEY! ITS ME, GOKU! I've spent a good chunk of my life training to be the 
      strongest fighter i can be, so naturally, web design isn't really my strong suit. So when
      I was told Mr Opara could make me a website that will help me find strong opponents to fight, 
      I was more than happy to employ him for his skills. The website is easy to use, viewable on mobile, 
      and colorful."
            -Son Goku, Protector of Earth
